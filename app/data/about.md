#### Intro
I'm a software developer and computational engineering student.
<br>
I'm available to consult on interesting projects. My areas of interest include reactive web design, high performance computing, and financial mathematics.
<br><br>
#### Currently
I'm working on a COVID-19 contact tracing application for use across The University of Texas at Austin.
<br><br>
#### Recently
I spent Spring 2020 with a team of researchers and developers at the Matter Lab, a research lab within the Child Mind Institute. In that time I've built scalable software applications, managed cloud data usage, and communicated constantly with an entirely remote team. In this role, I've gained experience with JavaScript (React, React Native, Vue), Python, and PHP (Laravel).
