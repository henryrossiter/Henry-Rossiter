#### Intro
I'm a software developer and computational engineering student.
<br>
I'm always available to consult on interesting projects. My areas of interest include reactive web design, high performance computing, and financial mathematics.
<br><br>
#### Currently
I've worked with a team of researchers and developers at the Matter Lab for over a year. In that time I've analyzed software scalability, managed cloud data usage, and communicated with an entirely remote team. I've also gained experience with various web frameworks such as React, Vue, and Laravel.

#### Travel / Geography

- I prefer mountains to beaches, but I'll settle for beaches every once in a while.

- I've been to over 20 countries, many of which I would like to revisit.

- I recently completed the Tour du Mont Blanc, an epic trek through Switzerland, Italy, and France.

#### I dream of

- sunny afternoons on my bicycle
- elegant UI/UX design
- hiking the Himalyan Mountains
