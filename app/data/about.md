#### Intro
I am a software developer and computational engineering student.
<br>
I am available to consult on interesting projects. I am particularly interested in reactive web design, high performance computing, and financial mathematics.
<br><br>
#### Currently
I've worked with a team of researchers and developers at the Matter Lab for over a year. In that time I have learned how to analyze software scalability, manage cloud data usage, and communicate with an entirely remote team. I've also gained experience with various web frameworks such as React, Vue, and Laravel.
